# NLP-project-on-Election-Data

In this particular project, we are going to work on the inaugural corpora from the nltk in Python. We will be looking at the following speeches of the Presidents of the United States of America:
President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1941
President John F. Kennedy in 1961
President Richard Nixon in 1973

### Finding the number of characters, words and sentences for the mentioned documents:

Character count, number of words and sentences was calculated from each of the speeches.

### Removing all the stopwords from all the three speeches:

Various stop words were identified using the package from Natural Language Toolkit: Corpus Readers.
Each of these stop words were removed from the speeches for better analysis of these speeches.

### Word frequency checks:

From each of these speeches after removal of stopwords, word freqencies were checked to understand the usage of words from each of the Presidents.
